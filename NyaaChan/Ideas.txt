I don't think you want just an upvote system. I think you want something more complex which integrates both votes and sharing across your platform with friends. Of course that is no longer an image board in the classical sense but it's better, more powerful, more interactive with users.


add a paint image, where everyone in the community can add to it. 
Like those community doodle sites. 
theres that one video of a guy going to a bunch of those boards are drawing the "rattle me bones" thing. 

Also, OP, it be cool to have some kind of marker thats not an ID or Name. You know how foruks let you have a banner after your post? Something like that. Maybe if you can have a temporary avatar for a thread. Like a gif or a sprite.
